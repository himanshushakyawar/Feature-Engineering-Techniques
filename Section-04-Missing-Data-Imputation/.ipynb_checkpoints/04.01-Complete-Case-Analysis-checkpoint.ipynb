    "## Complete Case Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete-case analysis (CCA), also called \"list-wise deletion\" of cases, consists in **discarding** observations where values in **any** of the variables are missing. Complete Case Analysis means literally analysing only those observations for which there is information in **all** of the variables in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which variables can I impute with CCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "CCA can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "CCA works well when the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). In fact, we should use CCA if we have reasons to believe that data is missing at random, and not otherwise. When data is MCAR, excluding observations with missing information is in essence the same as randomly excluding some observations from the dataset. Therefore the dataset after CCA is a fair representation of the original dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to implement\n",
    "- No data manipulation required\n",
    "- Preserves variable distribution (if data is MCAR, then the distribution of the variables of the reduced dataset should match the distribution in the original dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can exclude a large fraction of the original dataset (if missing data is abundant)\n",
    "- Excluded observations could be informative for the analysis (if data is not missing at random)\n",
    "- CCA will create a biased dataset if the complete cases differ from the original data (e.g., when missing information is in fact MAR or NMAR and not missing at random).\n",
    "- When using our models in production, the model will not know how to handle missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use CCA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is missing completely at random\n",
    "- No more than 5% of the total dataset contains missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, CCA may be an acceptable method when the amount of missing information is small. Unfortunately, there is no rule of thumb to determine how much missing data is small or negligible. However, as general guidance, if the total amount of missing data is ~5% of the original dataset or less, CCA is a viable option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real life datasets, the amount of missing data is never small, and therefore CCA is typically never an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CCA and models in production\n",
    "\n",
    "When using CCA, we remove all observations that contain missing information. However, the data that we want to score with our model, may indeed contain missing information. This will pose a problem when using our model in live systems, or as we call it, when putting or models into production: when an observation contains missing data, the model will not be able to handle it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid this problem, when putting models into production we need to do 1 of 2 things: either we do not score observations with missing data, or we replace the missing values by another number. We can choose any from the imputation techniques that we will discuss in the following lectures to replace NA in the data to be scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the House Prices dataset to demonstrate how to perform Complete Case Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
